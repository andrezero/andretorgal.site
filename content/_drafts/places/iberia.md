I am lucky to say I have covered quite a bit of ground around the Iberian peninsula, especially close to the shore.

This cosy corner of the world, shared by Portugal and Spain, stuck between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, is blessed with a diversity of coastal features, and it never gets boring.

Sandy coves hidden in the crooks of a cliff, majestic stretches of beach framed by dunes, lunar landscapes, river mouths with exquisite shapes, tidal pools, swamps, ... you name it.
