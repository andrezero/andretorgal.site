I am a _web developer and agile practitioner_ with a diverse background in engineering and management.

I have been coding, leading, mentoring and facilitating for 20 years.

<!-- abstract -->

I am _originally from Lisbon, Portugal_, where I cut my teeth as an engineer and manager, acquiring experience for 15 years across a few industries and companies such as [SAPO](https://sapo.pt) and [Quodis](http://quodis.com/).

I moved to _London in 2011_, worked 4 years at [EF Education First](http://ef.com), then as the Head of Frontend at [Property Partner](http://propertypartner.co), and as Agile Delivery Manager at [Nexmo](https://nexmo.com).

I arrived in _Barcelona in 2017_, where I taught Web Development at [Ironhack](https://ironhack.com), having had 93 students in roughly a year - intense - and later consulted for [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/).

### Mission

To experiment, learn, and grow in collaboration, inspiring others to do the same.

### Values

Love, Freedom and Imagination.

Courage, Integrity and Loyalty.

### Experience

<p class="year">1995</p>

My story with computers [goes way back](/about/story). Forward to 1995, when I created my first _personal website_. The browsers at the time? [Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape#Early_years) and [IE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_2). And dial-up bandwidth. On a good day, 30 kbps.

<p class="year">1999</p>

Me and some friends created our own webshop, _developed a CMS in PHP3_, streamlined a sales+delivery pipeline and went on to create websites for dozens of companies and institutions.

Unfortunately, the dot-com bubble was bursting. We were kind of late to this party, we had to move on.

<p class="year">2002</p>

Leading a small team of brave developers, designing and creating an innovative product, a first of the kind in the _automation industry_. Mostly using _web technologies_ for UI, but also going full hands-on with _industrial hardware_ - networks, card readers, gadgets and sensors of every kind.

Quite a reception from the market. Around mid 2006, there were 20 instances operating across the country, and plans to go much further.

<p class="year">2003</p>

(Re)discovering Agile since I first came across a certain manifesto. In the early 2000s, I was mostly learning _XP_ and _Agile Modeling_, and how to design and develop in collaboration, writing tests, pairing and reviewing.

<p class="year">2005</p>

The [WHATWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG) was rising, Firefox was launching. Dreaming about a better web again.

Became a full-time _frontend trainer/consultant_, helping teams in media companies and digital agencies, (re)adjusting to a more modern web: going from closed source to open source, to semantic _web standards_, to more _effective design/development_ collaboration.

<p class="year">2008</p>

At Portugal Telecom's [SAPO](https://sapo.pt) portal, learning about _large scale_ websites and services: distributed systems, _service oriented_ principles, low latency and _high availability_.

Superb opportunity to play with caches, buses, brokers, document databases, the works. And to _learn from the best_ engineers in Portugal.

While working there, built an entire new version of [SAPO Cinema](https://cinema.sapo.pt) and related web services. This popular online movies guide, scaled 4x its audience after launching the new version and peaked around a million monthly unique users.

<p class="year">2009</p>

So excited about Scrum, after running a few [ScrumBut](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrumbut) explorations, that I got a [CSP](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/atorgal) certification the next year.

Since then, regardless of my role as a Developer, Team Lead or Tech Lead, I have been at least _half Scrum Master_ in most of the teams I have worked with, integrating valuable lessons about _commitment, mindfulness, courage, respect and vulnerability_.

<p class="year">2010</p>

My last year in Portugal was spent _working with friends_ at [Quodis](http://quodis.com/), a company of five, including some of the best UX / designers out there.

We were pumping complex websites, _engaging campaigns and beautiful visualisations_ at an incredible pace.

And we still found time to organise _meet-ups and events_.

Great team, wonderful times :-)

<p class="year">2011</p>

Moved to London in 2011 as the first backend developer of a greenfield project within [EF](https://ef.com). The prototypes evolved into field tests, and the tests evolved into a mature platform. And the role evolved into _Tech Lead_.

The platform runs at a _global scale_, around the clock, delivering [free tests](https://www.efset.org/) to millions of users, assisting teachers in dozens of schools, supporting some of the research behind the [world's largest ranking of countries by English skills](http://www.ef.co.uk/epi/).

Also super proud to have helped building [EF Class](http://class.ef.com/), an innovative _EdTech_ product that helps teachers run engaging, interactive, and motivational lessons.

<p class="year">2015</p>

At [Property Partner](https://propertypartner.co) in a complex role with responsibilities in engineering, management and process. A constant challenge to balance _coding, leading, mentoring and facilitating_.

Guided the team towards a more mature Scrum, gradually introducing TDD, pairing, code reviews, gitflow, an _automated styleguide_ and CI practices, and facilitating _meaningful retrospectives and actionable insights_. Together, we grew to _deliver at a constant and sustainable pace_, releasing code to production every other day.

Great opportunity to explore _growth tools_. UX research, analytics, A/B testing, referrals, customer support, CRM, every trick in the book.

<p class="year">2017</p>

At [Nexmo](https://nexmo.com) as an Agile Delivery Manager, coaching a few teams through their discovery of Agile principles and values. Focused on _individuals and interactions first_: collaboration, face to face communication, courage, respect and vulnerability, explicit policies, pairing and mobbing.

Then, collaboratively exploring _Lean, Kanban, Kaizen_ and others, experimenting with practices and tools, evolving towards _flow, purpose and predictability_, reducing waste, defects, inventory and technical debt along the way.

<p class="year">2018</p>

At [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) as Lead Teacher for the WebDev bootcamp in Barcelona, _teaching full-stack web development_ - concepts, hacks and best practices - and sharing the love for _Agile values and practices_.

Great times at the [Barcelona campus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2cv8AV-lFs), working with an awesome team of motivated people with a growth mindset and a beautiful passion for continuous improvement. We iterated continuously on the curriculum, practices, and tools, establishing _feedback loops everywhere_ and capturing the process in _living documentation_.

Another highlight here, the constant collaboration between the UX/UI and WebDev bootcamps. It inspired an atmosphere of possibility, of a world where the "hand-over" is no longer a thing. Also, I guess along the way, I must have picked up a few things about _Design Thinking_ and _Service Design_.

Such a privilege to meet so many people, listen to _the most incredible life stories_, and learn new and unexpected things. Also a privilege to cross paths with all these students - ninety three of them - at such an extraordinary moment of their lives. :-)

<p class="year">2019</p>

At [Thoughtworks Spain](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), as Lead Consultant, trying to learn some serious consulting and influencing skills, as well as strengthen my XP and Software Design. Did not disappoint: such a wonderful group of talented individuals, so much knowledge sharing going on, and so much expertise everywhere, it can even become overwhelming and hard to keep up with!

I was lucky to work on a project with a mature CI/CD culture, and alongside experienced engineers, committed to best practices and quality. Great opportunity to work hands-on - mostly mobbing/pairing - with _serverless architecture_, _infrastructure as code_, _observability_, and other fancy stuff.

### Kudos

Throughout these awesome 2 decades, I have had the chance of working in _remarkable teams_. Together, we have experimented different ways of creating value and experienced the joy of positively impacting lives through our work.

It has been an absolute _privilege and pleasure_ to work alongside so many talented and inspiring individuals: business people, academics, engineers, and artists.

Particularly, the ones I had the even greater privilege of mentoring along the way. You all rock! And you will rule!
