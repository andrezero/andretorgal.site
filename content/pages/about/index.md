## House rules

Just to be clear: this is my space - I own the content, the opinions are my own, and it does not represent the company I work for at the moment.

If you find something that resonates with you, or otherwise object to, feel free to drop me a line via twitter [@andrezero](https://twitter.com/andrezero) or email [info@andretorgal.com](mailto:info@andretorgal.com).

## Work

A seasoned web developer and agile practitioner with a diverse background in engineering and management. I have been coding, leading, mentoring and facilitating for 20 years. Currently teaching Web Development in Barcelona, Spain. [Read more](/about/work).

## Personal

A curious and passionate person. My story includes computers, bicycles and skateboards. Guitars, drums, theater and photography. Economics, management, more computers. Software, methodologies, frameworks. [Read more](/about/story).

## Music

Bare with me while I collect my old stuff. Meanwhile, check out the latest tracks I recorded. [Read more](/about/music).

## One is a lie

- I once worked in an obscure, surreal, movie production, so my name is on [Imdb](https://imdb.com).
- I am afraid of heights, but I once bungee jumped from 68 meters high.
- Cristiano Ronaldo used to chill at my neighbour's house, but I never really talked to him.
- I got a tattoo of a French character done by an American dude in the Czech Republic.

## Coming soon

Got great plans for this website. I'm tired of dumping stuff in social media. More stuff coming soon.
