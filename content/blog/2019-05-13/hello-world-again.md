When I relaunched this website a little over 2 years ago, I was hoping to be posting here at least a couple of times a year. Ahem ... But, yes! the strategy and the ambitions did not expire. Here I am again: rebuilding the whole thing, enjoying React and static site generation and making plans to blog more often.

<!-- abstract -->

I wrote here a while ago why [the 8 years without a site of my own](/posts/2017-jan/hello-world). Meanwhile, I moved jobs a couple of times and even moved to a different country altogether, abandoning these plans in the process.

Blah, blah.

## Let's Fix It

I still believe that owning our content online is the way to go. Off with this broken model, _enough social media and algorithms_, and back to the basics, back to the true nature of the web.

As a consumer, I like to _surf, read, subscribe to things_, or simply stumble open them, bookmark them, save them for later. I enjoy following hashtags, _following topics, not algorithms_.

And as a creator, I want to live the freedom of dreaming up some stuff, experimenting, creating, sharing. Then breaking some shit, learning. Asking for help. Collaborating!

Check out this post by Matthias Ott about _Why_ and _How_ to go about [Weaving our Web](https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse). He explains it much better - and more eloquently - than I ever could. **#web #websites #letsfixit**.

## So What's Happening at andretorgal.com?

Started learning React more seriously some months ago and catching up on cool stuff such as [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), [CSS custom properties](https://css-tricks.com/guides/css-custom-properties/) and [browserslist](/meta/records/current/browser-support).

I feel I was just stumbling upon - _just like that :-)_ - a world of interesting possibilities.

That's when I decided to port my static website to [React Static + Typescript](/meta/records/current/stack-react-static-typescript), and model this kind of old school website, that's pretty much coming up [all modular and atomic-ish](/meta/records/current/conventions-structure-atomic-semantics).

Feels like 2008 again (don't confuse with [1998](https://24ways.org/2018/designing-your-site-like-its-1998/)). But unlike a decade ago, these days, the tools just seem to work, and provide you a great experience. And the browsers seem to be all [Yes you can!](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid) whereas before, they'd be all like [Oh no, you don't!](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills).

Best of times, so far.

## What's next?

There is a big [backlog](/meta/project/backlog). It includes better navigation, blog rolls, footnotes, publishing my design system, continuous integration and so much more.

But staging is coming soon. Just ironing out some details with asset extraction and responsive images.

Meanwhile, keep an eye on the [source code](https://github.com/andrezero/andretorgal.site/tree/master/src), if you're curious.
