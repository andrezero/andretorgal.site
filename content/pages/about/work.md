I am a _web developer and agile practitioner_ with a diverse background in engineering and management.

I have been coding, leading, mentoring and facilitating for 20 years.

<!-- abstract -->

I am _originally from Lisbon, Portugal_, where I cut my teeth as an engineer and manager, acquiring experience for 15 years across a few industries and companies such as **[SAPO](https://sapo.pt)** and **[Quodis](http://quodis.com/)**.

I moved to _London in 2011_, worked 4 years at **[EF Education First](http://ef.com)**, then as the Head of Frontend at **[Property Partner](http://propertypartner.co)**, and as Agile Delivery Manager at **[Nexmo (now Vonage)](https://vonage.com)**.

I arrived in _Barcelona in 2017_, where I taught Web Development at **[Ironhack coding school](https://ironhack.com)**, having had 93 students in little over a year. Since then, I worked briefly for **[Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/)** and I am currently a lead software engineer at **[New Relic](https://newrelic.com)**.

### Mission

> To experiment, learn, and grow in collaboration, inspiring others to do the same.

### Values

> Love, Freedom and Imagination.
>
> Courage, Integrity and Loyalty.

### Experience

#### Lisbon, Portugal

<p class="year">1995</p>

My story with computers [goes way back](/about/story). Forward to 1995, when I was finishing university and creating my first _personal website_. The browsers at the time? [Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape#Early_years) and [IE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_2). And dial-up bandwidth. On a good day, 30 kbps.

<p class="year">1996</p>

The 2 years after graduating felt a bit inadequate. The *degree in Economics* lined me up for a brief experience in the public sector, as a naif techno-junior. And then in commerce, as a mini person-suit struggling to find any [poetry in commerce](https://www.escritas.org/pt/t/171/ode-maritima).

I knew I could do so much more if I were creating things. Instead of audits, studies, deals.

<p class="year">1998</p>

It was only when I found a more technical role in the *parking systems and access control* industry that I felt I was truly creating value.

*Pre-sales* opened the opportunity to get involved and very much hands-on. Business analysis, requirements gathering, modeling, architecture, prototyping. Started playing around with VB, Delphi, databases, reports and learning about RAD, Rational, UML.

Somehow also got involved in training technical and sales staff and took an eye-opening *course on training and pedagogy*.

<p class="year">1999</p>

Me and some friends created our own webshop, _developed a CMS in PHP3_, streamlined a sales+delivery pipeline and went on to create websites for dozens of companies and institutions.

Unfortunately, as soon as this one and (so far) only attempt at being an entreperneur was starting to look like a serious business, the dot-com bubble collapsed the market appetitie for a couple of years. We were kind of late to the first party.

We had to move on, maybe jut for a while. But I think I became risk averse and never considered this path again.

<p class="year">2001</p>

My one big shot at pretending to capitalism followed, kind of by chance. A young maverick heir with sufficient funds and guts, someone I had previously impressed with my mix of business and tech skills, trusted me to articulate his vision into a *business plan* for a technical spin-off of his family's more traditional company.

In the first 2 years we saw the new company become the *most profitable business* of the group and the market leader in the national mobility space, expanding its offering to traffic management, access control and automation integrations.

Meanwhile I had myself back into a *role in marketing* in the now familiar, very real, very gritty, mobility industry. But
the business plan went beyond being a vendor and an integrator. We were also *building prototypes for our own product*, using Delphi, rudimentar electronics, and lots of creative glue. So we sold one, then two, then five. The product was viable, the demand was there.

<p class="year">2003</p>

Carefully extracting myself from the marketing duties, and now leading the R&D department and a small team of brave developers, I co-created an innovative product, *the first of the kind in the automation industry*. Using mostly _web technologies_ for UI, but also going full hands-on with industrial hardware - networks, card readers, gadgets and sensors of every kind - we created a unique modular system, capable of managing thousands of inputs and devices and integrating with other systems.

Good enough to manage the traffic flow in the carpark of an opera house. Or *monitor thousands of spots in an airport's car park* using sound sensors. Quite a reception from the market! When I left mid 2006 there were 20 instances operating across the country, and plans to go much further. Last time I checked, it was in production for over a decade and even sold to other countries.

<p class="year">2004</p>

(Re)discovering Agile since I first came across a certain manifesto. In the early 2000s, I was mostly learning _XP_ and _Agile Modeling_, and how to design and develop in collaboration, writing tests, pairing and reviewing code.

<p class="year">2005</p>

The [WHATWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG) was rising, Firefox was launching. I was dreaming about a better web again and wanting to work full-time with web techologies.

Became a full-time _frontend trainer/consultant_, helping teams in media companies and digital agencies, (re)adjusting to a more modern web: going from closed source to open source, to semantic _web standards_, to more _effective design/development_ collaboration.

<p class="year">2008</p>

When I landed a web-developer role at Portugal Telecom's **[SAPO](https://sapo.pt)** portal I knew I had done something right. It was a superb opportunity to _learn from the best_ engineers in Portugal at the time, and to have access to *web at scale* projects and mature tech.

While working there, built an entire new version of the [SAPO Cinema](https://cinema.sapo.pt) vertical, on top of a service oriented architecture, designed from scratch to be low latency and _high availability_.

The popular online movies guide scaled 4x its audience after launching the new version and peaked around a million monthly unique users.

<p class="year">2009</p>

So excited about Scrum, after running a few [ScrumBut](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrumbut) explorations, that I got a [CSP](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/atorgal) certification the next year.

Since then, regardless of my role as a Developer, Team Lead or Tech Lead, I have been at least _half Scrum Master_ in most of the teams I have worked with, integrating valuable lessons about _commitment, mindfulness, courage, respect and vulnerability_.

<p class="year">2010</p>

My last year in Portugal was spent _working with friends_ at **[Quodis](http://quodis.com/)**, a company of five, including some of the best UX / designers out there.

We were pumping complex websites, _engaging campaigns and beautiful visualisations_ at an incredible pace.

And we still found time to organise _meet-ups and events_.

Great team, wonderful times :-)

#### London, UK

<p class="year">2011</p>

Moved to London in 2011 as the first backend developer of a greenfield project within **[EF](https://ef.com)**. The prototypes evolved into field tests, and the tests evolved into a mature platform. And the role evolved into _Tech Lead_.

The platform runs at a _global scale_, around the clock, delivering [free tests](https://www.efset.org/) to millions of users, assisting teachers in dozens of schools, supporting some of the research behind the [world's largest ranking of countries by English skills](http://www.ef.co.uk/epi/).

Also super proud to have helped building [EF Class](http://class.ef.com/), an innovative _EdTech_ product that helps teachers run engaging, interactive, and motivational lessons.

<p class="year">2015</p>

At **[Property Partner](https://propertypartner.co)** in a complex role with responsibilities in engineering and management.

Guided the team towards a more mature Scrum, and gradually introducing TDD, pairing, code reviews, gitflow, an _automated styleguide_ and CI practices, as well as facilitating _meaningful retrospectives and actionable insights_. Together, we grew to _deliver at a constant and sustainable pace_, releasing code to production every other day.

Great opportunity to explore _growth tools_. UX research, analytics, A/B testing, referrals, customer support, CRM, every trick in the book.

<p class="year">2017</p>

At **[Nexmo (now Vonage)](https://vonage.com)** as an Agile Delivery Manager, coaching a few teams through their discovery of Agile principles and values. Focused on _individuals and interactions first_: collaboration, face to face communication, courage, respect and vulnerability, explicit policies, pairing and mobbing.

Then, collaboratively exploring _Lean, Kanban, Kaizen_ and others, experimenting with practices and tools, evolving towards _flow, purpose and predictability_, reducing waste, defects, inventory and technical debt along the way.

#### Barcelona, Spain

<p class="year">2017</p>

At **[Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/)** as Lead Teacher for the WebDev bootcamp in Barcelona, _teaching full-stack web development_ - concepts, hacks and best practices - and sharing the love for _Agile values and practices_.

Great times at the [Barcelona campus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2cv8AV-lFs), working with an awesome team of motivated people with a growth mindset and a beautiful passion for continuous improvement. We iterated continuously on the curriculum, practices, and tools, establishing _feedback loops everywhere_ and capturing the process in _living documentation_.

Another highlight here, the constant collaboration between the UX/UI and WebDev bootcamps. It inspired an atmosphere of possibility, of a world where the "hand-over" is no longer a thing. I guess that along the way, I must have picked up a few things about _Design Thinking_ and _Service Design_.

Such a privilege to meet so many people, listen to _the most incredible life stories_, and learn new and unexpected things. Also a privilege to cross paths with all these students - ninety three of them - at such an extraordinary moment of their lives. :-)

<p class="year">2018</p>

At **[Thoughtworks Spain](https://www.thoughtworks.com/)**, as Lead Consultant, trying to learn some serious consulting and influencing skills, as well as strengthen my XP and Software Design. Did not disappoint: such a wonderful group of talented individuals, so much knowledge sharing going on, and so much expertise everywhere, it can even become overwhelming and hard to keep up with!

I was lucky to work on a large [e-commerce platform](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/getting-smart-applying-continuous-delivery-data-science-drive-car-sales) with a mature CI/CD culture, and alongside experienced engineers, committed to best practices and quality. Great opportunity to work hands-on - mostly mobbing/pairing - with _serverless architecture_, _infrastructure as code_, _observability_, and other fancy stuff.

<p class="year">2019</p>

As a lead developer, at **[New Relic](https://newrelic.com)**, developing and maintained a very large frontend code base, within the world’s biggest [observability platform](https://newrelic.com/platform), mentoring other engineers in XP practices, requirements gathering, analysis and technical writing, architecture, design patterns, frontend development, web standards and browser APIs.

As the Technical Product Manager, also managing the technical roadmap and planning iterations, reducing risks and toil and improving performance, instrumentation, observability, and availability.

### Kudos

Throughout these awesome 2 decades, I have had the chance of working in _remarkable teams_. Together, we have experimented different ways of creating value and experienced the joy of positively impacting lives through our work.

It has been an absolute _privilege and pleasure_ to work alongside so many talented and inspiring individuals: business people, academics, engineers, and artists.

Particularly, the ones I had the even greater privilege of mentoring along the way. You all rock! And you will rule!
