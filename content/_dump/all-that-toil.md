If there is something I regret in my career so far is not having yet made a significant contribution to the open source commons. At some point I was sort of at peace with this, but someone opened a PR against one of my forgotten repos in github, and that re-opened this old wound.

<!-- abstract -->

This got me going through memories, retrospecting a bit about what I have done so far, and especially about the missed opportunities.

## Starting my own projects

Back in 1999, I created an entire CMS written in PHP3 :scream: for our own little web-shop. Our entrepeneurial effort tanked a bit later and the project was abandoned. In hindsight, I should've taken it to [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) even if I would have - most probably - given up when I realised [Drupal, and later Wordpress](https://enonic.com/blog/the-history-of-cms--what-has-happened), were so much better than my naif approach.

I only really had the conviction that I was on to something interesting twice in the next 20 years. I thought that the Node.js community is lacking a set of patterns and libraries for a [DDD approach](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/domain-driven-design-intro/) to enterprise services. But I couldn't get anyone I knew excited about this. I did a couple of PoC and a round of contacting friends, but they were totally turned off either by _enterprise_ or _Node.js_. Enough said.

## Helping my employer open source their IP

In the end, did I contribute at all? Maybe.

As of 2019, the [ef-ctx](https://github.com/ef-ctx/?q=&type=source) organisation had 29 public sources, but only a few of them had forks outside EF's direct collaboration network.

Most of them had an appropriate LICENSE attached, but some were also missing the CONTRIBUTING guide.



## Contributing to other projects

This should be the first option, period. There are hundreds of projects out there, with a vast array of needs. I have occasionally reported issues, open tiny PRs to fix minor, obvious, stuff. But what about _significant contribution_? Not really. A couple of times I tried to go a bit deeper I ended up committed the cardinal sin of promising and not delivering. And knowing that I might have messed up someone's expectations made me step back for good.

As I write these words, a package was delivered to our door.
