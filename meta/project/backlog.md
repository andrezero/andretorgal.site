## Later

- [ ] search
- [ ] make data available to the 404 page
  - [ ] fix/workaround issue of `getRouteData()` being useless here
  - [ ] refactor routes code, decouple routes from sources so that data from one source can be used in different routers

## Issues

- [ ] `react-dom.development.js:522 Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, /tags/social-web` in `/tags`

### a11y

- [ ] acessible routing: scroll to top when clicking on link to current page (and no anchor in link)

### React Static

- [ ] `7.0.10` errors when builing for production: `Error: React-Hot-Loader: Hot Module Replacement is not enabled`
- [ ] `7.0.9` noise when building for production
- [ ] `7.0.9` error with webpack-dev-server - `Uncaught SyntaxError: The URL 'http:/[http//localhost]:3000' is invalid` - patched with `"resolutions": { "react-static/webpack-dev-server": "3.2.1" }` in `package.json`
- [ ] maximum call stack error when using helmet with children, following [issue here](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/issues/1119)
- [ ] 404 has no access to `getRouteData()` because it looks up the failed route instead of the `404` path

### Typescript

- [ ] Types for `rehype-raw` `rehype-react` `remark-parse` and `remark-rehype` added manually, waiting for [this PR](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/383) to be merged, posted on [unified community](https://spectrum.chat/unified/type-definitions/missing-typings-across-plugin-community~49ee93c0-23bf-49f3-9706-2468b0760564)

### Puzzles

- [ ] `react-static` [docs](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/blob/master/meta/api.md#reloadClientData) mentions `reloadCliendData()` should be used to re-render when data changes, but I only got it to work by using the undocumented api `rebuildRoutes()`
- [ ] `@reach/router` [anchor link support](https://github.com/reach/router/issues/235) and how to tame [focus and scroll on long content](https://github.com/reach/router/issues/62)
- [ ] [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) seems to report time to first interaction thinking that the page is waiting for react to render (when in fact is just hydrating)

### Spikes

- [ ] [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/typescript) how to have side by side (or plugged to) the unified, remark, rehype pipeline

- [ ] [solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/)

  - [ ] [linked-data-developer-experience](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2018/12/28/designing-a-linked-data-developer-experience/)

- [ ] svg trickery
  - [ ] via [postcss](https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-write-svg)
