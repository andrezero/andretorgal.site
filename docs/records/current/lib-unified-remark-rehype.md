title: 'Library: Unified + Remark + Rehype'
---

> Why

- modular library, many plugins
- trasnforms to react
- works in both directions
- complete [working implementation](https://github.com/s-thom/website/blob/develop/src/components/MdRenderer/index.tsx)

> Trade-offs

- not written in typescript and no typings supplied for many plugins
- incomplete/inconsistent docs
- many repos, different authors
