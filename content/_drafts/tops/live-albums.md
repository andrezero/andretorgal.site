Introducing my fixation for music albums and lists. As seen from 2020, a time where the whole idea of album has lost most of its meaning. Starting with the "live at", "in concert" category because I was always a big fan of these. Here's my little tribute.

<!-- abstract -->

If you ask me what's the *best* album of *all times*, of a certain band, genre or decade my answer is more and more likely to be a *live* album. Just the same way that when I hear about a new band I rush to check if there is a [KEXP](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3I2GFN_F8WudD_2jUZbojA) or a [Tiny Desk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A) of them, because I want to see the people and their music happening.

Let's put aside the fact that *no one* listens to albums anymore, or even talk about music in those terms. Let's also ignore the fact that I hate to talk in absolute terms. Now, first check what I did right there, and then hold my beer whyle I attempt to build a list, pretending it makes some sense and the world totally needs it.

## My favorite 17 live albums.

In order of when they first entered my life. Only criteria is that they were significant to me and my growing appreciation of live music recordings.

## [1982] Simon And Garfunkel - The Concert in Central Park

![The Concert in Central Park - Album Cover|lu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sgconcertincentralpark.jpg](./albums/simon-and-garfunkel--concert-in-central-park.jpg)

I guess this is the album that kicked off my fascination for live music. I was probably 11 when I found it, so right around the time it was released. It was part of the record collection of at least one of my cool uncles and/or aunts and it was kind of a family favorite. So thank you family, for this introduction.

I probably took a tape home and listened to it a million times. And when back at my uncle's, I would pull out the sleeve and read the lyrics back to back. Or play *50 Ways to Leave Your Lover* on repeat until I drilled all the words, silly rhymes, and puns into my little sponge brain.

But as I sit now through a back to back listen, it looks like I memorised much more than just lyrics. It's all coming back to me. Not only I remember which song comes next, the lyrics are coming back pretty fast as well. And, whoa! I remember all these funny little speeches in between songs.

> Well is great to do a neighborhood concert. *[.. screaming ..]* I hope everyone can hear us. I hope that the sound is good. *[.. acknowledgement ..]* I hope we are blasting Central Park West and Fifth avenue pretty much away *[.. whistles ..]*. I just want to thank the Police Department and the Fire Department and the Parks Commissioner, and Ed Koch. *[.. booing ..]*
> And Particularly, you know, people that never get recognized for doing good deeds for the city *[.. yeah ..]*, a group of people that have donated half of the proceeds that they're making tonight, the guys who are selling loose joints *[.. yeah ..]* are giving the city half of their income tonight *[.. rawring ..]*.

Not that I knew who Ed Koch was, and why that sounded like a joke to those on stage. Neither I knew what a *joint* was, and neither did I care. But I do remember asking why the crowd always goes *[.. yeah ..]* a bit after each song starts. *It's when they recognise their favorite song is next*.

I think I got really fascinated by the whole stage vs audience dialog, and the fact that you could play it back over and over, picking up people shouting words between songs, during songs. The whole thing captured in deep stereo field with such fidelity that with my eyes closed it was possible to get an almost video-like image of that huge crowd.

> We wanted to have fireworks tonight. But they wouldn't let us have that. Well, let's go make our own fireworks tonight.

Listening to this now, it is a very time bound piece.

## [1986] Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band - Live/1975-85

![Live/1975-85 - Album Cover|lu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bruce_Springsteen_Live_75-85.jpg](./albums/bruce-springsteen-and-the-e-street-band--live-1975-1985.png)

I had been obsessing with the Boss for a couple of years, since I got a copy of *Born in the USA*, when a friend found this five vinyl record release in their parents collection and recorded the whole thing into 3 cassetes for my 13th birthday.

Just learned this is 2nd best-selling album of all time in the US and I am not surprised at all. These are the 10 years that *made* the Boss, backed by the founding members of the *E-street Band*, including Max Weinberg, Clarence Clemons, and Garry Tallen. And it goes on to include stints of Steve Van Zandt, Patti Scialfa, and Nils Lofgren.

## [1984] Dire Straits - Alchemy: Dire Straits Live

I watched this on video first, at my cousin's, when I was super young. They were big fans, so probably they this when it came out. My cousin would play back to me and point all the details, this guitar, the other guitar, and how Mark Knopfler would throw his.


A year later, some neighbour showed it to me again and I was hooked. Although it's another guitar centric live album, with plenty of long, long solos, it is not a jammy at all, even though there is an element of improvisation in the guitar solos. It's all carefully

## [1973] Led Zeppelin - The Song Remains the Same

As good as some of the Led Zeppelin studio albums may be, no matter how unreproducible live might be their later studio recordings, this is the sound that comes to might when I think of most of their songs.
[Listen on Spotify to The Song Remains the Same](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ui4S0TZghkf1d1Wz0oWpk?si=ok5xCisiTmy3-k4Q0hymNg).

If you never watched this, do find the time. Bare in mind the sound on this youtube video is a bit fake, but it's the same recording from Madison Square Garden. The footage of the minimum stage in such a big venue is puzzling. But it makes an ever better scenario for a Page vs Plant self-indulgent battle of the egos, violion bow, the works, keeping the creative juices flowing for over 30 mins on a single song.

Maybe you also want to check some [footage from John Bonnan's solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOSf9f5_qZ8) after you realise that the Moby Dick track is almost 10 mins of Bonzo time. When I was in high-school, listening to it was accessible, because cassettes. But I knew people that described that had seen it on VHS and I would happily sit there forever, listening to someone describe Bonnan's kit and drumming. And we'd convinced ourselves trhough vigorous air drums that we had memorise the whole piece.

I can't remeber how I got hold of a tape with this concert. I actually think it was incomplete. But I remember I played it endlessly. Trying to imitate solos on my acoustic guitar again and again. Not even playing much attention, just tripping, acting out on my bed room, pretending to be Jimmy Page.

For some reason, this tape never survived and I actually forgot I ever had it. It was only recently that I came across the epic footage on youtube and then tracked it down again on Spotify.

## [1991] Faith No More - Live at the Brixton Academy

It pains that I lived in Lambeth for 6 years and never watched a show in here. Commuted via Brixton hundreds of times, cycled there right in front of the Academy, and checked out the bill for the night, but no one really interesting was ever playing. I remember having some food around in the evening and watching the cues. Taking the metro and being harrased by the scalpers selling fake tickets to whatever. I remember coming back home drunk from the office pub, as one does in London, and watching people coming out the Academy after a show.

## [1988] Chet Baker - Live in Hannover

I remember I discovered this one in 1994 and it blew me away, heart and soul, the very first moment.

A parent of one of my friends had an extensive, and expensive, Jazz collection including a load of [ECM](https://www.ecmrecords.com/home) rarities. This is Chet Baker's last concert,

It features Radio Orchestra Hannover and NDR Big Band. It is superbly recorded. In some moments you have him whispering a faint cry in your hair and you can hear the spit in his lips, in the trumpet's mouthpiece. Next moment it's string ensemble or big band. Then back to a delicate guitar solo and soft brush.

I got it on tape and fell aslepp many times listening to this. Must have lost the tape before 1998 because when I wanted to share this with my wife, I couldn't find it anymore.

## [1969] Jefferson Airplane - Bless Its Pointed Little Head

![Bless Its Pointed Little Head - Album Cover|lu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BlessItsPointedLittleHead.jpg](./albums/jefferson-airplane--bless-Its-pointed-ittle-head.png)

Going through a few articles out there, including this [Rolling Stone Greatest Live Albums](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-live-albums-of-all-time-173246/the-replacements-the-shit-hits-the-fans-1985-154247/), checking if was forgetting something dear to my heart, I verified that are a few albums I should really check out and I started with this Jefferson Airplane one, going in very sceptical about the quality of the recording.

Trippy as I was guessing. Long solos, mantra like moments, but also great dynamics, great bursts of energy. Recorded between two venues - San Francisco and New York - with an extraordinary quality and mixed with a very wide stereo field: rhythm guitar full left, then the bass, drums, voices, lead guitar on the right end. Also, a lot of depth and ambience, with the audience in between cuts providing a rough idea of what these venues were like. [Listen on Spotify to Bless Its Pointed Little Head](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ZkdTV6IV5arY4hS6ztM2g?si=xw5cuVQOR9GKvJX0xAMuwg). Great jamming potential, going to come back often at decent times so I can play along.
