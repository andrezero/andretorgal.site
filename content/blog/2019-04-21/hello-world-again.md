<div id="guay-abstract">
I relaunched this website a little over two years ago, hoping I would be posting here at least a couple of times a year. Meanwhile, I moved jobs a couple of times and even moved to a different country altogether, abandoning my plan in the process. But the ambition didn't expire and I still believe that owning my content online is the way to go. So, here we are again: rebuilding the whole thing on top of a React based static site generator and making plans to blog more often.
