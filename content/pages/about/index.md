My name is Andr√© Torgal and this is my website, a place where I [blog](/posts) some thoughts and run a few [experiments](/experiments).

Here, you can learn more about me, [my work](/about/work), and other stuff I have been up to.

## House rules

![inline](./imgs/international-sloth-day.jpg#image:default)

Just to be clear: this is my space - I own the content, the opinions are my own, and it does not represent the company I work for at the moment.

If you find something that resonates with you, or otherwise object to, feel free to drop me a line via twitter [@andrezero](https://twitter.com/andrezero) or email [info@andretorgal.com](mailto:info@andretorgal.com).

Also, If you are curious about how this website ~~was built~~ is being built, take a look at [the docs](/meta).

### Music

Bare with me while I collect my old stuff. Meanwhile, check out the latest tracks I recorded. [Read more](/about/music).

### One is a lie

- I once worked in an obscure, surreal, movie production, so my name is on [Imdb](https://imdb.com).
- I am afraid of heights, but I once bungee jumped from 68 meters high.
- Cristiano Ronaldo used to chill at my neighbour's house, but I never really talked to him.
- I got a tattoo of a French character done by an American dude in the Czech Republic.

## Coming soon

Got great plans for this website. [I am tired of dumping stuff in social media](/posts/2019-may/hello-world-again). More stuff coming soon.
